# Polar Scanning Algorithm

Polar Scanning Algorithm is the an advanced version of the Elliptical Scanning algorithm specified in Espinosa's paper ([link](https://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/25887/1/espinosa_et_al.pdf)). This is not only more robust and handles more distorted ring images well, it is also computationally more efficient. 

This algorithm detects the labels of the rings in a placido ring image which can be extremely helpful for corneal topography. 

Run the file **example.m** to see the result of the algorithm. Unfortunately, this has not been compensated for broken rings. The compensated algorithm can be found in the full code folder for the corneal topographer. [link](https://github.com/psurya1994/corneal-topography-using-placido-rings)
